will change when the set of required properties is changed

GetTargetBlockTime returns the TargetBlockTime field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetTargetBlockTimeOk

`func (o *TargetBlockTime) GetTargetBlockTimeOk() (*int32, bool)`

GetTargetBlockTimeOk returns a tuple with the TargetBlockTime field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
