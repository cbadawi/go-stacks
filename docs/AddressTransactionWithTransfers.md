## Methods

### NewAddressTransactionWithTransfers

`func NewAddressTransactionWithTransfers(tx Transaction, stxSent string, stxReceived string, stxTransfers []AddressTransactionWithTransfersStxTransfersInner, ) *AddressTransactionWithTransfers`

NewAddressTransactionWithTransfers instantiates a new AddressTransactionWithTransfers object

and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewAddressTransactionWithTransfersWithDefaults

`func NewAddressTransactionWithTransfersWithDefaults() *AddressTransactionWithTransfers`
